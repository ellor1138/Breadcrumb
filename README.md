# Breadcrumb

## What is it?

Breadcrumb is a breadcrumb trail navigation generator plugin for ColdFusion on Wheels. 

#### Benefits of using this plugin:
* Automatically create a breadcrumb trail navigation based on your controller/action.
* Manually build your breadcrumb trail navigation by passing an array of struct in your controller's action.
* Exclude certain words from your breadcrumb trail navigation by creating a "black list".
* Customize the hierarchy separator and styles of the breadcrumb trail navigation.
* The plugin can also set the title of your HTML page based on the breadcrumb trail. You can also set the page title manually if needs be.
* Can be use in conjunction with the <a href="https://github.com/ellor1138/Localizator" target="_blank">Localizator</a> plugin, to add localization (translation) capabilities.
